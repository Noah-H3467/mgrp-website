# Haxophone
Small travel digital saxophone under $100 that provides a satisfactory user experience. Features the same fingering as a real saxophone.
The hardware is a HAT (Hardware attached on top) product for a Raspberry Pi single board computer. The software is free to use.

The haxophone isn’t intended to replace the saxophone → it’s simply for scenarios where it is inconvenient to bring or set up a real saxophone.

# Pi-hole
the network-wide ad blocker (a less common approach to blocking ads) and network manager.
(This project is software that is intended to be run on linux hardware, which includes Raspberry Pi)

# Phenotiki (2016, published 2017)
An open software and hardware platform for affordable and easy image-based phenotyping of rosette-shaped plants. Intended to be easy to install and deploy.
A project from research papers (will put this before my analytical essay)
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/tpj.13472
From “A comprehensive review on applications of Raspberry Pi” source
# XRP - Short for the “Experiential Robotics Platform”
Uses Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller
https://experientialrobotics.org/
The XRP is a compact, cost-effective robotic platform designed to provide students, educators, and teams with an authentic and rigorous introduction to robotics programming. 
It was developed through a collaboration between WPI and DEKA Research & Development Corp. It aims to deliver an experiential learning experience that is both comprehensive and accessible to help level the STEM playing field globally and create a future generation of STEM innovators and technology leaders.

# Monitor your plants with Pico 
This project by the Arm Software Developers team sends text message reminders to water a plant based on data from a soil moisture sensor.
Specifically uses Pico with wiring tricks to use the Grow HAT instead of a full size Raspberry Pi to save energy
Their choice to utilize a Pico explains why one particular Raspberry Pi product is more suitable than another (in this case, the microcontroller was more energy efficient).
It is helpful to be aware of the differences between computer boards. The Diagram (link to diagram) includes some popular examples.

# NASA Engineers make Raspberry Pi-powered ISS Mimic→ education - ish engagement -- expository?
https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/qa-with-nasa-engineers-behind-raspberry-pi-powered-iss-mimic/ 
“Mechatronic Instantiated Model, Interactively Controlled.”
I actually got to see this contraption in demo at the FIRST World Championships
Scaled down version of ISS, mirrors (“mimics”) what the real one does in orbit by receiving data.
“1/100th scale for 1/100,000,000th cost”
As of publication, NASA was working towards making a kit of parts for sale for those without a 3d printer or time to print the pieces, with a discount for educators. This project connects to Raspberry Pi's underlying educational and inspiration roots, and if NASA enjoys working with Raspberry Pi products, then perhaps the Raspberry Pi team succeded in their four technical goals for their Raspberry Pi hardware, as discussed in the Expository Essay.

# AI-enabled Hear The World device describes its surroundings → theme: ai, pairs with literary criticism (AI vs “logics”)
Swiss software engineer and cloud architecture specialist Marco Gerber developed a ‘point-and-shoot’ device that provides a text and audio description of the user’s surroundings.
His “Hear The World”device is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
It is the AI in the project that can describe the environment, which can help people with visual or hearing impairments. Such clever projects showcase how people can utilize AI for the betterment of the world, a counterexample to the short story “A Logic Named Joe”.

# Astro Pi → pairs with the Infographic (the Astro Pi Challenge box)
https://www.esa.int/Education/AstroPI/What_is_an_Astro_Pi
https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/astro-pi-is-10-a-decade-of-your-code-in-space/
Describe what the Astro Pi hardware is
Then the scope of the project
Young people get to send python code to one of two Astro Pis in the ISS.
