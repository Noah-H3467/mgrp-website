Lying down and by came my Raspberry Pi
On my table for years, since then—
For all that time I didn't give it a try -
Now that I wanted to, I didn’t know when

In 2006, Eben Upton then
Saw the state of computing education was awry
He had an idea, scrambled in 2011—
Lying down and by came my Raspberry Pi

Then sophomore year I learned to code in Py-
-thon and the keyboard became my fountain pen
I coded for Robotics, but forgot to try my Raspberry Pi—
On my table for years since then

From debugging my code over and over again
Turns out I like to use my mind's eye
Still regretting that I didn't stick with it way back when
For all that time I didn't give it a try

At first it was tough, but I learned to fly
Understanding Java, OOP, and next web dev
Learned Arduino, and next, Raspberry Pi?
Now that I wanted to, I didn’t know when—

For I was stuck grinding school, teams, apps, past 12 am.
During Winter Break, I had time! To oversimplify—
My Pi browsed slowly, I couldn’t update it again!
So for now, I’ll leave my old Raspberry Pi
Lying down and by
